    "Sometimes we want to ignore certain assets when computing pipeline expresssions. There are two common cases where ignoring assets is useful:\n",
    "1. We want to compute an expression that's computationally expensive, and we know we only care about results for certain assets. A common example of such an expensive expression is a `Factor` computing the coefficients of a regression ([RollingLinearRegressionOfReturns](https://www.quantopian.com/help#quantopian_pipeline_factors_RollingLinearRegressionOfReturns)).\n",
    "2. We want to compute an expression that performs comparisons between assets, but we only want those comparisons to be performed against a subset of all assets. For example, we might want to use the `Factor` method `top` to compute the top 200 assets by earnings yield, ignoring assets that don't meet some liquidity constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support these two use-cases, all `Factors` and many `Factor` methods can accept a mask argument, which must be a `Filter` indicating which assets to consider when computing."

    "Let's say we want our pipeline to output securities with a high or low percent difference but we also only want to consider securities with a dollar volume above $10,000,000. To do this, let's rearrange our `make_pipeline` function so that we first create the `high_dollar_volume` filter. We can then use this filter as a `mask` for moving average factors by passing `high_dollar_volume` as the `mask` argument to `SimpleMovingAverage`."
