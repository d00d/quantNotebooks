"""This algorithm demonstrates the concept of long-short equity.
It uses two fundamental factors to rank equities in our universe.
It then longs the top of the ranking and shorts the bottom.
For information on long-short equity strategies, please see the corresponding
lecture on our lectures page:

https://www.quantopian.com/lectures

WARNING: These factors were selected because they worked in the past over the specific time period we choose.
We do not anticipate them working in the future. In practice finding your own factors is the hardest
part of developing any long-short equity strategy. This algorithm is meant to serve as a framework for testing your own ranking factors.

This algorithm was developed as part of
Quantopian's Lecture Series. Please direct any
questions, feedback, or corrections to max@quantopian.com
