# # AlphaLens Tear Sheet
# Alphalens takes a given factor and examines how useful it is for predicting relative value through a collection of different metrics. The analysis pull various quantifiable signals onto similar scoring scales, then use the factor scores in systematical investing strategies. It breaks all the stocks in a given universe into different quantiles based on their ranking according to your factor and analyzes the returns, information coefficient (IC), the turnover of each quantile, and provides a breakdown of returns and IC by sector.   
# 
# The purpose of our factor analysis is to trace the connection between price performance and underlying stocksâ€™ periodical factor characteristics. Building portfolios of alpha factors allows us to more carefully monitor and analyze the source and consistency of our returns.  Much of this gears to determining if an alpha factor is suitable for a long-short equity algorithm (typically to choose assets to long that will do better than the assets to short) If our ranking scheme is predictive, this means that assets in the top basket will tend to outperform assets in the bottom basket. As long this spread is consistent over time our strategy will have a positive return.  This analysis also provides some feel for correlation & turnover, thus relevant to assess for a long or short strategy respectively.  What we want when comparing factors is to make sure the chosen signal is actually predictive of relative price movements. 
# 
# ### factor_information_coefficient
# Computes the Spearman Rank Correlation based Information Coefficient (IC)between factor values and N period forward returns for each period in the factor index. Params: factor_data : pd.DataFrame - A MultiIndex DataFrame indexed by date (level 0) and asset (level 1), containing the values for a single alpha factor, forward returns for each period, the factor quantile/bin that factor value belongs to, and (optionally) the group the asset belongs to.
# 
# ### factor_rank_autocorrelation
# Autocorrelation of mean factor ranks in specified time spans.  We must compare period to period factor ranks rather than factor values to account for systematic shifts in the factor values of all names or names within a group. This metric is useful for measuring the turnover of a factor. If the value of a factor for each name changes randomly from period to period, we'd expect an autocorrelation of 0.
# 
# ### average_cumulative_return_by_quantile
# Plots sector-wise mean daily returns for factor quantiles across provided forward price movement columns.
# 
# ### quantile_turnover
# Computes the proportion of names in a factor quantile that were not in that quantile in the previous period.
# 
# ### compute_mean_returns_spread
# Computes the difference between the mean returns of two quantiles. Optionally, computes the standard error
# of this difference.
# 
# ### mean_return_by_quantile
# Computes mean returns for factor quantiles across provided forward returns columns.
# 
# ### factor_alpha_beta
# Compute the alpha (excess returns), alpha t-stat (alpha significance), and beta (market exposure) of a factor. A regression is run with the period wise factor universe mean return as the independent variable
# and mean period wise return from a portfolio weighted by factor values as the dependent variable.
# 
# ### factor_returns
#  Computes period wise returns for portfolio weighted by factor values. Weights are computed by demeaning factors and dividing    by the sum of their absolute value (achieving gross leverage of 1).
