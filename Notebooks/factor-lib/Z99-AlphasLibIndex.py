The below is a list of many factors. Taken from several sources,
these factors have been forecast to generate alpha signals either
alone or in combination with eachother. These can form the basis
of factors trading algoithms.
NB: Morningstar cash_flow_statement, income_statement, earnings_report are quarterly
NB: Morningstar ratios are avoided, unless they yield ostensibly better data than otherwise
NB: Multiples of 4 are due to the fact that some metrics are
released quarterly and some are released annually. This is a good approximation and the least comutationally
expensive way to calculate these metrics
